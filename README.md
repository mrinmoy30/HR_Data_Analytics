## 1. Business Requirements üéØ

The primary goal of this dashboard is to answer key business questions regarding employee turnover and provide actionable insights. The core objectives addressed are:

### KPI Requirements:

- **Total Employees:** The overall count of active and former employees in the dataset.
- **Attrition Count:** The total number of employees who have left the company.
- **Attrition Rate:** The percentage of the total workforce that has left.
- **Average Age:** The average age of the employees in the dataset.
- **Average Years at Company:** The average tenure of employees within the company.

## Analysis Requirements (Visualizations):

- Quantify the overall attrition rate and absolute number of leavers.
- Identify which departments experience the highest attrition rates.
- Pinpoint specific job roles with elevated turnover.
- Analyze how attrition rates vary across different employee age groups.
- Determine the attrition count based on marital status.
- Assess the impact of working overtime on the likelihood of leaving.
- Understand the relationship between employee-reported Work Life Balance and attrition counts.
- Compare the average monthly income of employees who left versus those who stayed, segmented by job role.
- Analyze the correlation between the number of years since an employee's last promotion and their attrition rate.

## 2. Data Processing & Transformation (ETL) üõ†Ô∏è

The following data processing and transformation steps were performed, primarily using Power BI's Power Query and DAX:

- **Data Loading:** Imported the **HR Data.xlsx** - HR data.csv file into Power BI.
- **Data Type Verification:** Ensured columns were assigned appropriate data types (e.g., numeric, text).
- **Calculated Columns:** Utilized existing columns like **CF_age band** and **CF_attrition** label for analysis.

## 3. Data Modeling üîó

Created key **DAX measures** to drive the **KPI** visuals and charts:

- **`Total Employees = SUM('HR Data'[Employee Count])`**
- **`Attrition Count = CALCULATE( [Total Employees], 'HR Data'[CF_attrition label] = "Ex-Employees" )`**
- **`Attrition Rate = DIVIDE( [Attrition Count], [Total Employees] ) (Formatted as %)`**
- **`Average Age = AVERAGE('HR Data'[Age])`**
- **`Avg Years at Company = AVERAGE('HR Data'[Years At Company])`**
- **`Avg Monthly Income = AVERAGE('HR Data'[Monthly Income])`**

- **Measure Table:** Grouped all created DAX measures into a dedicated **`_Measures`** table for better organization.

## 4. Dashboard Design & Visualizations üìä

The analysis is presented on a single-page Power BI dashboard. Interactive slicers allow for dynamic exploration of the data.

## 5. How to Use This Dashboard ü§î

This interactive dashboard allows for flexible data exploration:

- **Open the `.pbix` file** in Power BI Desktop.
- **Overall View:** Start by observing the main KPIs (Attrition Rate, Count, etc.) at the top for a high-level summary.
- **Identify Problem Areas:** Use the "Attrition Rate by Department" and "Attrition Rate by Job Role" charts to quickly see which areas have the highest turnover percentages.
- **Demographic Focus:** Examine the "Attrition Rate by Age Band" and "Attrition Count by Marital Status" charts to understand which demographic groups are most affected.

### Explore Drivers:

- Analyze the "Attrition Count by OverTime" donut chart. Crucially, remember this shows counts; the underlying rate difference is the key insight.
- Examine the "Attrition Count by Work Life Balance" chart. Again, focus on the insight that the highest rate is for 'Bad' balance, even if the count is lower.
- Use the "Avg Monthly Income..." chart to compare compensation between those who left and stayed within specific roles.
- Interpret the "Attrition Rate by Years Since Last Promotion" line chart to see how career progression timing relates to leaving.
- Interactive Filtering: Use the Slicers (Department, Job Role, Gender, Age Band) at the top left to filter the entire dashboard. For example:
- Select "Sales" in the Department slicer to see specific attrition rates, age distributions, and income comparisons only for the Sales department.
- Select "Sales Representative" in the Job Role slicer to drill down into the data for this high-attrition group.
- Combine filters (e.g., "Sales" department and "0-25" Age Band) for highly specific analysis.

## 5. Data-Driven Insights üí°

- **KPI Summary:** The company has **1470** employees with an overall attrition count of **237**, resulting in a **16.12%** attrition rate. The average employee age is **36.92** years, staying **7.01** years on average.
- **Slicer Interactivity:** Allows filtering across **Departments (Sales, HR, R&D)**, specific Job Roles, Gender, and pre-defined **Age Bands (0-25, 25-34, etc.)**.
- **Departmental Rates:** **Sales (20.63%)** and **HR (19.05%)** show significantly higher attrition rates than **R&D (13.84%)**.
- **Job Role Rates:** **Sales** Representatives have an extremely high **39.76%** attrition rate. **Laboratory Technicians (23.94%)** and **Human Resources (23.08%)** also show elevated rates.
- **Age Band Rates:** The **0-25** age group has the highest attrition rate **(39.18%)**, followed by the **25-34** group **(20.22%)**. Rates decrease for older groups.
- **Marital Status Counts:** **Single** employees account for the largest number of leavers **(120, 50.6%)**, followed by **Married (84)** and **Divorced (33)**. (Rate analysis shows **Singles** also have the highest attrition rate).
- **Overtime Counts:** Slightly more leavers worked **Overtime (127)** than did not **(110)**. (Rate analysis shows **OverTime** dramatically increases attrition risk).
- **Work Life Balance Counts:** Most leavers rated WLB as **'3' (Better) (127)**. However, rate analysis indicates those rating **'1' (Bad)** have the highest probability of leaving, despite lower volume **(25)**.
- **Income Comparison:** Average Monthly Income for **Ex-Employees** is visibly **lower** than for **Current Employees** in key roles like **Research Scientist** and **Healthcare Representative**.
- **Promotion Timing Rates:** Attrition Rate is **highest** for those **0 years** or **7+ years** since their last promotion, suggesting issues with both **early and later career stagnation**.

## 6. Business Impact üöÄ

The identified attrition patterns have direct financial and operational consequences:

- **Financial Drain:** Replacing **237** employees, especially the high volume from **R&D (133)** and high-rate roles like **Sales Reps (33)**, incurs substantial recruitment, onboarding, and lost productivity costs annually.
- **Talent Pipeline Risk:** Losing nearly **40%** of employees **under 25** undermines future leadership potential and ROI on early-career investments.
- **Operational Instability:** High turnover in **Sales (20.63% rate)** and key technical roles like **Lab Technicians (23.94% rate)** can disrupt customer relationships, project timelines, and innovation efforts.
- **Potential Burnout Culture:** The strong correlation between **Overtime (30.5% attrition rate)** and poor **Work-Life Balance ratings (31.3% attrition rate for 'Bad' rating)** suggests underlying issues affecting employee well-being and engagement.
